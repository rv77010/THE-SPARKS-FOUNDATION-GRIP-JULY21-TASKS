# THE-SPARKS-FOUNDATION-GRIP-JULY21-TASKS
This Repository hosted for showcasing task performed as "DATA SCIENCE INTERN" during Graduate Rotation Internship Program(GRIP) at The Sparks Foundations.
The Sparks Foundation Internship Program
GADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (GRIP)
The Sparks Foundation offers one month Internship program to the students in different fields:

Data Science and Analytics.
Web Development.
App Development.
Business Analytics.
I am also enrolled in the Data Science and Analytics Internship offered by The Sparks Foundation for the Duration of AUG 2020-SEP 2020. During this internship program, they assigned me 5 Tasks with a deadline before which we have to submit the task by hosting a GitHub Repository. Along with this repository we have to also post our task in the LinkedIn and Telegram group of the organisation.

This internship program donot focus only on our technical skills infact it also help us to increase our social interaction and bonding by there tasks. The 5 tasks which were assigned to me was:

LinkedIn Improvement Task.
To explore Supervised Learning.
To explore Unsupervised Learning.
To explore Decision Tree Algorithm.
To explore Business Analytics.
LinkedIn Improvement Task:
In this Task we have improve our LinkedIn profile by adding our domain related cover photo, a pleasent Profile photo and have to send connection requests to most of the members of the Sparks Foundation LinkedIn group.
To explore Supervised Learning:
In this Task, the we have to use the Scores dataset provided by the Sparks Foundation and using supervised ML algorithms such as LinearRegression/LassoCV, based on our choice we have to create a model for predicting the Marks of a student can score based on their study hours.
To explore Unsupervised Learning:
In this Task, the we have to use the iris dataset provided by the Sparks Foundation. In this task we have to work on K-means algorithm and our main task will be to find the optimum number of clusters using Python.
To explore Decision Tree Algorithm:
In this Task, the we have to use the same iris dataset provided by the Sparks Foundation. In this task we have Make a Decision Tree using Decision Tree Algorithm and have to visualise the same using some visualisation libraries present in Python.
To explore Business Analytics:
In this Task, The Sparks Foundation have provided a SampleSuperMarket Dataset. This task have no model answer, and this is the most creative task of this internship. To complete this task we have multiple option of tools such as Excel, Tableau, Power BI and Python. We can use any of these tools and develop a dashboard contains analysis of Dataset. We have to also find the business issues through this dataset and to recommend the solution of the business problems.
